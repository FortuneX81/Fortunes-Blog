# The Daily Byte - News Blog Website

## Project Description
The Daily Byte is a news blog website that displays technology, health, and education news using a card-based layout. The website is built using HTML and CSS and is hosted for free using GitHub Pages.

## How the Website Works
The website uses a card-based layout to display news articles. Each article is contained in a card that includes an image, a headline, and a short description. The layout is created using CSS Flexbox to arrange cards neatly across the page. Shadow effects and hover animations are used to improve visual appearance and user interaction.

Images are wrapped in semantic HTML tags using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to provide proper captions and improve accessibility. Each image also includes an `alt` attribute to support screen readers and follow HTML best practices.
